This document outlines the design of name resolution, type checking,
and other static analysis phases of the Joos 1W language as
implemented in our compiler. It also discusses some challenges faced
while implementing these phases.


\section{Design}

All components of the compiler implemented for name resolution, type
checking, and static analysis are centered around the AST. Either by
transforming the AST, replacing portions of the AST with more
conveinent non-tree structures, or injecting functionality.


, transforming, post parsing, are Various components of the thingy were designed by augmenting or
replacing the ASTs that were generated from parsing. We have one AST
for each compilation unit that we are compiling. For the first
assignment there was only ever one AST, but as of the second
assignment the compiler handles an arbitrary number of ASTs being
created and processed.

\subsection{Name Resolution}

The first step in name resolution was to parse each AST and create
entity objects for each type of declared entity. We define an entity
in the same way that the JLS does:

\begin{quote}
A declared entity is a \tbf{package}, \tbf{class} type,
\tbf{interface} type, member (class,interface, \tbf{field}, or
\tbf{method}) of a reference type, \tbf{parameter} (to a method,
constructor, or exception handler), or \tbf{local variable}.
\end{quote}

For the entities that Joos supports; \ttt{Package}, \ttt{Class},
\ttt{Interface}, \ttt{Field}, \ttt{Method}, \ttt{Parameter}, and
\ttt{LocalVariable}; we have created classes that make accessing the
metadata of the entity easier and more efficient than repeatedly
navigating an AST.


\subsubsection{Type Environment}

After initially parsing the AST into the entity models, we can build
the type environment by building the package hierarchy and linking
imported types and packages into the compilation units that request
them.
