\part{Design}

Some preamble to design talk goes here.


\section{Tokens}

A set of classes which make lexing and parsing simpler, and abstracts
part of the weeding process from the lexer and parser.

Some more description. Maybe a code listing or example.


\section{Lexer}

It does stuff with a DFA and generates a stream of tokens from code
input.

Rejecting non-ASCII code is handled during this phase.


\section{Weeder}

Magic! Reject all programs that use non-Joos keywords, literal
integers that are outside of allowed ranges, and strings that include
invalid escape sequences.


\section{Abstract Syntax Tree}

Or whatever data abstraction we end up with for parsing.


\section{Parser}

It takes a stream of tokens from the lexer and does some other stuff.


\section{Other Requirements}

Some assignment requirements did not fit well into any other portion
of the compiler that has been designed so far. Or maybe not\ldots
